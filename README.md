# Information-retrival-Models
This is a project that involved preprocessing articles in XML file format and building information retrieval models with the data. 

the files are split into the three questions that were asked and there is a txt file with the output for each question.

the common English words txt file is a list of stop words used in the preprocessing to take out non-relevant words.

Rnews_v1 has the 10 XML files used in the project

the Stemming folder has the Porter2 algorithm used for stemming the documents

Task 1 involves making functions to to process the relevant data in the XML documents and using the porter2 algorithm to create terms and then calculate their frequency within the document. 

Task 2 uses the TDIFD equations to find the term's weight within the corpus of documents and then build an informational retrieval model to find relevant documents to a query.

Task 3 required the BM25 equation to build an information retrieval model to find the most relevant documents based on 4 quires
